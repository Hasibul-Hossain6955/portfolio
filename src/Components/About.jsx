          I'm an IT student specializing in Information and Communication
          Engineering, with a passion for building modern web applications.
          Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into full-stack development and working
          with technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Next.js,
          and TypeScript.

          Beyond academics, I enjoy taking on real-world projects, such as
          developing a university field booking system. Whether it's working
          with Firebase authentication or integrating Google login in React
          apps, I thrive on solving complex problems.
